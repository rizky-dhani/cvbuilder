# Product Guidelines - CV Builder

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Empowering:** Our communication is serious but encouraging. We position the platform as a sophisticated career partner that empowers users to take control of their professional narrative.
- **Expert but Accessible:** We provide high-value career tools without using unnecessary jargon.
- **Supportive:** We recognize that job seeking and career management can be stressful; our tone should provide a sense of order and confidence.

## Visual Identity
- **Modern Corporate:** The aesthetic is clean, professional, and reliable.
- **Palette:** Primary colors include deep professional blues, supported by clean grays and crisp whites.
- **Typography:** Clear, legible sans-serif fonts for the UI to ensure readability across all devices.
- **Layout:** Highly structured, grid-based layouts that emphasize organization and hierarchy.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Structured Efficiency:** Use a component-based editor where data entry is separated from visual representation to ensure consistency and speed.
- **Live Feedback:** Provide real-time previews so users can see the impact of their changes immediately.
- **Contextual Assistance:** Offer tips and examples (e.g., action verbs for work experience) at the point of entry.
- **Personalized Notifications:** All Filament CRUD operations (Create, Edit, Delete) must provide success notifications that follow the format: "(resource) successfully (action)" (e.g., "Education successfully created", "Work experience successfully updated", "Skill successfully deleted").

## Brand Values
- **Organization:** The platform's primary value is bringing order to the chaotic process of career management.
- **Clarity:** We prioritize the effective presentation of information over decorative elements.
- **Trust:** Security and reliability are non-negotiable, given the sensitive nature of user data.
